# backbone-starter

This is just a starter template that I use in SharePoint front end dev. The list of JavaScript files that this starter users is:

jquery: 3.2.1  
underscore: 1.8.3  
backbone: 1.3.3  

Some browsers don't support fetch yet so when you are trying to load pnp.js into your browser, make sure you have these JavaScript libraries loaded for pnpjs:
